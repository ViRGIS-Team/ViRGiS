  summary: "\ntree of Oriented Boxes (OBB) for a Polygon2d. \nConstruction is sequential, ie pairs of segments are merged into boxes, then pairs of boxes, and so on\n\n[TODO] is this the best strategy? is there maybe some kind of sorting/sweepline algo?\n[TODO] would it make more sense to have more than just 2 segments at lowest level?\n\n"
