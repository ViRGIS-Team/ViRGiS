# Mesh Data Abstraction Library

Mesh Data Abstraction Library (MDAL) is a C++ library for handling unstructured mesh data released with MIT license. It provides a single data model for multiple supported data formats. MDAL is used by QGIS for data access for mesh layers.

MDAL is used in ViRGiS to import Data Meshes.

A Data Mesh is any mesh that includes data values as parameters and is not just a shape.
