# Point Data Abstraction Library

PDAL is a C++ BSD library for translating and manipulating point cloud data. It is very much like the GDAL library which handles raster and vector data. The About page provides high level overview of the library and its philosophy. Visit Readers and Writers to list data formats it supports, and see Filters for filtering operations that you can apply with PDAL.

PDAL is used extensively in ViRGiS to manipulate raster and point cloud data.
